        <p>This piece was for my third project in Character Design with Steve Bryant. I drew Husk from Hazbin hotel in a nior/speakeasy type bar, all while adding the four card symbols.</p>
        <p>This piece was for my second project in Character Design with Steve Bryant. I drew Alastor from Hazbin hotel, Markiplier, and Sebastion from Black Butler all in my style.</p>
        <img class="Men" src="Project 2 - Crossovers copy.png" alt="Men">
        <img class="Gojo" src="Turnaround Skyler R.. copy.png" alt="Gojo">
        <p>This piece was for my first project in Character Design with Steve Bryant. I drew Gojo from Jujutsu Kaisen. This first project was a turnaround to work on propotions and same posing.</p>
	<p>This piece is the first piece for my summer course, digital painting with Steve Bryant. This first project was assigned with the intent on mashing multiple images together and making a cohesive piece.</p>

	<img class="persona" src="Digital Painting Assignment Two.png">
	<p>This work was my second assignment for digital painting, this assignment was geared towards emulating another artists style. I used the style at the end of the game Persona 5 Royal, used in the end credits. I then drew Gojo from Jujutsu Kaisen in this style.</p>
	<p>This is the third piece from my digital painting course. We were given multiple different prompts for this assignment, I decided to go with the instrument smasher one. Which depicted an orc woman smashing a guitar.</p>

	<img class="grave" src="Assignment 4 Digital Painting.png">
	<p>This was the final piece I did for digital painting. Our point of reference was to choose a poem, song, or any type of literature and make an art piece based on it. I choose the song "Gravedigger" by Livingston, where I drew my own grave. I wanted this piece to be symbolic as the end of the class, the end of my sophomore year, with a whole new and even more motivated me.</p>
